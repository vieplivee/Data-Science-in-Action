# What is data science

I have been a data scientist for about two years. Here are some quick thoughts on what I think data science is. Or, why don't we start with what data science is not.

First, data science is not a software engineering piece of work. That is, data science is not about building products or product features or systems or any related fancy things.

Second, data science is not a visualization piece of work. Creating the cool visual is neither the end goal nor the beginning part of how a data scientist works. Needless to say, data science is not about creating visually impactful infographics.

Third, data science is not a scientific piece of work. In particular, data scientists don't work in the academia. It is the industry's particular requirements and the business markets' call that makes the job of data scientist needed. Data scientists usually don't publish papers, and neither is the paper or book publishing business part of any data scientists' daily concerns.

Last but not least, I don't agree with the public view that data science is, at least mostly, statistics. Just to cite a quick story of myself. Once I was asked to hire someone to assist my work and ended up interviewing lots of applicants through phone. Many of the applicants came from the filed of statistical analysis and most of these applicants tended to sound really confident that he or she would be more than qualified for the role. However, I didn't end up calling any of them on-site. One thing I realized at that time was that statistical knowledge alone doesn't make a person qualified for assisting me effectively on the kind of data science work that I needed to do, for reasons I'll mention in a short while.

Now, we are ready to talk about what data science is. It's a thing that encapsulates some programming skills, some statistical readiness, some visualization techniques, and, last but not least, a lot of business senses. The kind of business sense that I in particular care about is the ability and willingness, sometimes eagerness, to translate any business questions into questions answerable using currently or forthcomingly available data within one's reach. In fact, it takes a special way of connecting all the dots in the random world full of data most of which you may not find immediately useful to make a working data scientist.

A data scientist, based on my current understanding, is the person who connects the dots between the business world and the data world. Similarly, data science is the craft that a data scientist utilizes to make this happen.

I'm going to share a favorite analogue of mine about data science. Doing data science is like preparing a meal. One starts with data munging, which includes but is not restricted to ETL (extract, transform, and load), data cleansing, data debugging, etc. This is the step similar to preparing the food source, where you rinse cleans the vegetables, the meat, and the rice, chop the food source into reasonably sized pieces, and put them aside. After that is done, you are ready to cook the food source, which corresponds to data exploration, feature construction, feature reduction, running and ensembling the algorithms, etc. This is when you cook the vegetable and meat in a step-by-step fashion, adding ingredients and sources on particularly calculated timing, and watching the raw material turn into edible pieces. The last step is to serve the food, when you arrange the cooked food in artistic ways and serve them in a particular sequence of first course, second course, etc, to customers who ordered the food to begin with. This is when you prepare your data mining results in artistic visualization and create reports or data stories to send to the business users who wanted this piece of data science work to be done on the first place.

Summarizing the above, the process of data science consists of data munging, data mining, and delivering actionable insights. Based on my own experience, a common toolset to get all or part of these done include Python, R, Tableau, SQL, etc.

Python is particularly handy as an all-purpose tool especially great for data munging. It can also be used for data mining, thanks to the almighty scikit-learn package, and even insight delivering based on its fast growing graphing abilities.

R is a bit shy on data munging compared to Python. However, because of its nature of being "statistically complete" - a word I just made up, meaning that any statistical thingie you have ever heard of is most likely already represented by a R package, or two - R is great for exploring the data and running algorithms on different parameter settings. This makes R a great tool for prototyping data science - for example, to identify the key feature set as well as a good enough machine learning algorithm with parameter setting, before you start to write complicated production code for "real". In addition to the above, R is also powerful with its visualization packages and can be used to turn a repeatable data mining piece into a shiny report.
Talking about data visualization, Tableau is one of the best commercial software for visually explore your data. It is also handy for creating interactive visualization reports or data stories.

Besides Python, R, Tableau, there's one more data science tool that I want to mention before finishing this post. SQL is the language of English in the world of data munging, or at least have been so for a very long time. It is powerful in integrating different data sources, and handy for data exploration and data debugging.

These are just my two cents on what data science is. I hope it make sense to you so far. I'm still a learner, and merely a beginner in this field, and I expect to pick up a lot more and deeper understanding on this subject matter in the near future.
