# How I got into the field of data science 

----

I got into the field of data science by lots of accidents.

First of all, I was trained in the field of pure math, namely, abstract combinatorics. After teaching in different colleges and universities for years, it became increasingly frustrating to locate a reasonable job in the academy. It was not a difficult decision for me to try some luck in the industry, without any prior idea of how it will become, since I have never even tried to learn programming before.

By accident I started as a database developer, working exclusively on SQL Server. Naturally, Transact-SQL (T-SQL) became my first language in the industry. It took me about two weeks to start writing in SQL for small queries, about three months to feel comfortable working on the production system, and about six months to be fluent at working out tasks by writing stored procedures, jobs, user defined functions, etc. The more I learned, the more I enjoyed it. In the meanwhile I became more and more intrigued by the beauty of data manipulation, especially the part where you extract information from data by joining the data pieces together. One of the most fun thing I did at that time was to create a daily job to extract user-level activity detail from a gigantic piece of transaction logs. The end result of this activity summary provided enormous value to answer lots of business questions that were nowhere near answerable before.

By accident again, at that time, an opening in the business intelligence team drew me to the field of data analysis completely. Since then I’ve been working as a data scientist who handles the complete pipeline from data extraction, data cleansing, data munging, data exploration, model building and evaluation, up towards finally delivery.

It may sound like that all the academic training and paper publication business has been a waste of my life since I’m no longer actively working on that. However I doubt that was the case. When I looked back, it is increasingly obvious that the most important part that backed me up in the rapid development of my personal career path is my solid number sense. For one thing, looking for patterns in numbers is more a natural instinct than a trained perspective, and I’m naturally capable of checking solutions with trained academic rigor to make sure not to “lie” with statistics. Also, through academic years I’m used to constantly learn new concepts and methods by reading books and papers, and that has paved the way for me to pick up nearly any business or statistical concepts with relative ease. What is more, since I’m used to think in abstract terms, picking up the abstraction in programming languages has been the easiest part for me — the hard part is to learn the syntax.

That said, there’s still so much more fun things to learn and to try. I’m really looking forward to the next set of challenges I’d have to face in the field of data mining.
